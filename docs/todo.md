1. Define data models and their fields:
   - Identify the main data models required for the system (e.g., Person, Conversation, Transaction, Property, Participant).
   - Describe each model's purpose and how they interact with each other.
   - Define the fields and attributes for each model, ensuring they align with the product requirements and functionality.

2. Define the main backend components and create abstract classes/interfaces:
   - Identify the core backend components and services needed to support the AI assistant's functionality (e.g., ConversationManager, ActionProcessor, IntegrationManager).
   - Create abstract classes or interfaces for these components, defining their responsibilities and methods.
   - Ensure that the component design is modular, scalable, and allows for future extensions and integrations.

3. Create a wireframe of the frontend:
   - Sketch out the main pages and components of the frontend interface on paper.
   - Define the layout, navigation, and user interaction flow for the agent-facing web app.
   - Consider the key features and functionalities that need to be accessible to the agent (e.g., conversation view, action approval, settings).

4. Choose the backend stack:
   - Based on your existing knowledge and the requirements gathered during the previous steps, evaluate and choose the backend technologies and frameworks.
   - Consider factors such as scalability, performance, familiarity, and community support when making your decision.
   - Keep in mind the specific needs of the AI assistant, such as integration with language models, data storage, and real-time communication.

5. Define the product roadmap:
   - Identify the core features and functionalities that are essential for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
   - Prioritize the development tasks based on their importance and dependencies.
   - Plan for additional features and enhancements to be implemented after the MVP launch.
   - Consider the timeline, resources, and potential challenges associated with each phase of the roadmap.

6. Start coding:
   - Set up the development environment and choose the appropriate tools and libraries.
   - Begin implementing the backend components, starting with the core functionalities and gradually adding more features.
   - Develop the frontend interface based on the wireframes and integrate it with the backend services.
   - Implement the AI assistant's conversation management, action processing, and integration capabilities.
   - Continuously test, debug, and refine the codebase to ensure stability, performance, and alignment with the product requirements.

7. Testing and iteration:
   - Conduct thorough testing of the AI assistant, covering various scenarios, edge cases, and user interactions.
   - Gather feedback from early users (such as your mom) and iterate on the product based on their insights and suggestions.
   - Continuously monitor the system's performance, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary optimizations.
